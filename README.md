# exceptions
Exceptions library for C and C++

# Information
These are the exception libraries in C and C++ that I use for every single one of my projects that requires error handling. They are quick, easy to write, efficient, and customizable.

# Installation
All you have to do to use these libraries in your own C/C++ project is to go into the desired folder and copy the `exceptions.h(pp)` file, paste it into your project, and include the header like so:
```cpp
#include "exceptions.h"
#include "exceptions.hpp"
```
